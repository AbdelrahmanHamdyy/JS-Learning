//************* OOP IN JS (Prototypes) ***************

// Prototype contains methods and objects can access these methods
// Objects are linked to a prototypal object
// Prototypal inheritance -> The prototype contains methods (behaviour) that are accessible to all objects linked to that prototype
// Ex: Array.prototype is the prototype of all array objects we create
